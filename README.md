# Module-3-Project
A front-end project reflecting skills learned

## A Game Called "POP PAL"

Drawing major inspiration from the following video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=icO3YuuE1m0

Our module-3 Front End Project is to create a virtual version of the "Pop It" toy that can be played on any "touch" capable device with some neat features added that will hopefully make it more interesting than other "Pop It" apps that are available.
